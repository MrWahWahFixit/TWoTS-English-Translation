      STR_SHOTGUN_SHELLS: "Shotgun Shells"
      STR_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "The Franchi SPAS-12 was originally a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. However, the popular civilian models were prohibited from having semi-automatic functionality, and finding an original model nowadays is next to impossible. Equipped with a foldable stock, these shotguns are suitable for close-combat. Usable only on the surface."
      STR_LMG: "Machine Gun"
      STR_LMG_CLIP: "Machine Gun Ammo Box"
      STR_LMG_UFOPEDIA: "An old standard issue manual machine gun. This model used to be a mainstay of infantries around the world, but after a few terms of service, they became infamous for their barrels' tendency to rust. All production for military use ceased, and the guns were eventually sold to the general public. Despite looking worn, these guns are notoriously powerful. Usable only on the surface."
      STR_XRIFLE: "X-Rifle"
      STR_XRIFLE_CLIP: "X-Rifle Clip"
      STR_XRIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A modern military rifle built with the newest weapon technologies. Precise and powerful, they come equipped with high-tech targeters and bullet over-acceleration systems. Usable only on the surface."

      STR_FREEZER_UFOPEDIA: "As noted in our researcher's report, this weapon shoots an ionized stream of a specific chemical compound in a 'nonconforming high-energy state'. In practice, it means that this weapon will freeze its target, sometimes even to death.{NEWLINE}Close range. 30% damage done to Health. Damages TU."
      STR_FREEZER_CLIP: "Freezer Clip"
      STR_FREEZER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This cell contains specific chemicals and a Zrbite power source and can be fired from the Freezer."
      STR_PROJECTOR: "M.C. Projector"
      STR_PROJECTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is actually a cyborg used by high-ranking aliens to increase M.C. skills if their own skills are lacking. Aside from many abilities useful in everyday work, it can be used as a self-defense weapon. In this mode it projects powerful telekinetic pulses, which damages material objects (like armored suits or walls) and slows targets (reduces TU). It can also cause heavy wounds, although this is not its main purpose."
      STR_MC_FOCUS: "M.C. Focuser"
      STR_MC_FOCUS_UFOPEDIA: "This device converts the user's M.C. potential into destructive vibrations which can be concentrated on a nearby point in space. This effectively allows the user to destroy targets through walls. M.C. training required.{NEWLINE}Power bonus: M.C. Strength*0.5{NEWLINE}Accuracy: M.C. Skill*2.5{NEWLINE}Max. range: 8"
      STR_MCBA_HAND: "M.C.B.A. Emitter"
      STR_MCBA_HAND_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is integrated into M.C. Battlearmor and uses the oper-{NEWLINE}ator's energy.

Skill*2, Energy used: 6{NEWLINE}RANGED ATTACK> pyrokinetic pulse, which burns targets alive.{NEWLINE}Damage bonus: M.C. Strength*0.2,{NEWLINE}Acc: M.C. Skill*2, Energy used: 10,{NEWLINE}Max. range: 15"
      STR_SOLITONE_BOMB: "Solitone Bomb"
      STR_SOLITONE_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny device creates single destructive sonic wave, but unlike the Sonic Pulser's blast, this sonic wave is perfectly coherent. The effects of such intense physical interference are as expected: the wave penetrates armor and causes heavy shock to live organisms.{NEWLINE}Ignores half armor. {NEWLINE}Reduces Morale and TU."
      STR_SOLITONE_CHARGE: "Solitone Charge"
      STR_SOLITONE_CHARGE_UFOPEDIA: "This is an enlarged version of the Alien solitone generator. It creates a powerful, ideal sonic wave of a coherent tone, causing extreme damage and shock.{NEWLINE}Ignores half armor. Reduces Morale and TU."
      STR_ELERIUM: Inert Elerium
      STR_ELERIUM_UFOPEDIA: "As indicated in our research, prolonged contact with salt water renders Elerium-115 completely inert. Inert Elerium is useless as an energy source, but its scientific value makes it a commodity."
      STR_CHURCH_DATA: "Church Data Bank"
      STR_CHURCH_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The presence of Aquatoids in a city center was a great surprise to us. We now understand that cultists have been helped by the Aliens to restore an artifact salvaged from a UFO that was shot down during the previous war. Analysis shows that this is an Alien computer, which contains mostly communication protocols, but it also capable of hyperwave broadcasts. We are unable to decipher the broadcasts, but we have found a list of previous broadcasts. Shockingly, the first record seems to be a repeating message dated from over ten years ago.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Importantly, we've also found copies of S.O.R.E.S.O. reports stolen from our archives. Among other things, they contain the approximate location of the 'Khimtar' crash site. By strange coincidence, it is near the shipwreck of the RMS Titanic.{NEWLINE}Terabytes of personal data of cult members were found there, too. However, such personal data is of no value to us, so we've transferred the data to Interpol, which will hopefully curtail the threat of the Church of Sirius."
      STR_SORESO_WRECK: "Khimtar Prototype Black Box"
      STR_SORESO_WRECK_UFOPEDIA: "Our analysis of the prototype wreckage indicates that the craft was sunk during an attack from an unknown enemy. According to our aquanauts' reports, the wreckage area was infested with Xarquids, which are capable of such attacks. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}In addition to telemetry and other technical specifications, we found a matrix of map coordinates. We believe these coordinates mark UFO crash sites from the previous war."
      STR_NAGA_SOCIETY: "Naga Society"
      STR_NAGA_SOCIETY_UFOPEDIA: "Now we know that the ancient myths were true. Naga dwelled in the oceans for millennia and contacted humans at regular intervals. What is more important to us, however, is the discovery that they've built temples on the sea bottom, which are undoubtedly devoted to their underwater god. Some of these facilities can be located now that we know what to search for."
      STR_SYNOM: "Alien Synomium Device Fragments"
      STR_SYNOM_U: "Synomium Device"
      STR_SYNOM_UFOPEDIA: "The working principles of this device remain a mystery. We hypothesize that it uses weak electromagnetic fields of high frequency to make some kind of connection with an unknown signal source. Using communications protocols extracted from a high-ranked Alien navigator, we can read the data from this source and partially decipher transmissions from the Alien communications network."
      STR_MC_DISRUPTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This advanced M.C. device allows its users to directly interfere with a host's implant. The device may only be used by aquanauts with M.C. skills. Successful attack with the disruptor causes the unit to becomes confused and it may panic.{NEWLINE}Requires direct line of sight and has limited range.{NEWLINE}Max. Range: 15m"
      STR_MC_CONTROLLER: "M.C. Controller"
      STR_MC_CONTROLLER_UFOPEDIA: "The ultimate in M.C. technology, this device does not require direct line of sight nor does it have a maximum range. It may only be used by aquanauts with M.C. skills. Click on the Controller, select the type of attack, and select a target unit with the cursor. There are two types of attacks:{NEWLINE}JAM IMPLANT> If successful the unit becomes confused and it may panic.{NEWLINE}CONTROL IMPLANT> If successful you will gain control of the enemy unit."
      STR_MOLECTRONICS: "Alien Molectronic Components"
#techs
      STR_INTRODUC: "The Mary Celeste Sinkings"
      STR_INTRODUC_UFOPEDIA: "In the past few years, shipping and civilian travel organizations all over the world became concerned as surface vessels and aircraft began disappearing with alarming frequency while crossing the world's oceans. Reports of strange submersible vehicles spotted at the sites of some of the disappearances were dismissed by world governments, but not by the general public. Responding to tabloid accounts of another possible Alien invasion, the public cried out for the governments of the world to reactivate the heroic X-Com organization as a precautionary measure.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Starting from the end of the previous Alien War, an organization called Sub-Oceanic Reconnaissance and Extraterrestrial Salvage Operations (S.O.R.E.S.O.), owned by F. Denman Williams, has been employed cataloging underwater UFO crash sites to then search for sealed Elerium containers among the wreckage. To appease the public, the world governments have taken control of key S.O.R.E.S.O. assets and have officially established 'Ocean Base 1' as X-Com's first operational command center." 
      STR_OCEAN1: "Ocean Base 1"
      STR_OCEAN1_UFOPEDIA: "Ocean Base 1 is our new headquarters. Confronting aquatic threats is a new effort for X-Com, so our tactics and weaponry must be developed practically from scratch. Though we possess some aquatic equipment, more complex tools must be researched, designed, and developed specifically for these needs. Resources from the previous war will be of little help to us because all Elerium reserves have long since been exhausted, and almost all Alien technology based on Elerium requires it to function. Even our newest and best alloys use Elerium as a reactant for fabrication."
      STR_OCEAN2: "Water Pressure Complications"
      STR_OCEAN2_UFOPEDIA: "The ocean is a harsh environment, and below certain depths water pressure becomes a factor. If the aquanaut's armor has any breaches, he/she will take stun damage each turn. At the moment, it's the only downside to wearing armor. This applies if Aquanauts dive too deep with the Aqualung armor."

      STR_SPECWEAP: "Special Weapons Acquisition"
      STR_SPECWEAP_DUMMY: "Special Weapons Acquisition"
      STR_SPECWEAP_UFOPEDIA: "Our suppliers have negotiated agreements with key weapons contractors for the army and navy.

      STR_OLD_WEAPONS: "Surface Weapons Acquisition"
      STR_OLD_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Repeated terror attacks show us that some of this war's battles will be fought on land. Since concentrating on developing surface-only weapons would be unwise, we should simply order modern military-grade equipment for use on land. Luckily, our suppliers have already reached further agreements with arms dealers.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available orders: {NEWLINE}     X-Rifle{NEWLINE}     Stun Grenade"
      STR_LASER_WEAPONS: "Laser Weapons Acquisition"
      STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "If our enemies can get their hands on laser weapons, why can't we? Our supply network has expanded to include contacts who can provide newly developed weaponry of this variety. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available orders: {NEWLINE}     Laser Rifle{NEWLINE}     Laser Cutter"
      STR_AQUAWEAP: "Self-propelled Projectiles"
      STR_AQUAWEAP_DUMMY: "Self-propelled Projectiles"
      STR_AQUAWEAP_UFOPEDIA: "If we want to win the subsea war, we'll need proper weaponry. Self-propelled rounds can travel much farther underwater, and with modern technology we can achieve accuracy comparable with that of common surface firearms. Advanced projectiles of this kind may level the playing field for our aquanauts and maybe even our interceptors.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available manufacturing projects:{NEWLINE}     Dart Pistol{NEWLINE}     Dart Autogun{NEWLINE}     Jet Harpoon Rifle"
      STR_AQUAWEAP_2: "Heavy Aquatic Weapons"
      STR_AQUAWEAP_2_UFOPEDIA: "The resilience of our enemies demands more firepower, and the potential of self-propelled rounds has not been fully realized. We can now manufacture heavier weapons for aquatic warfare. {NEWLINE}Important note: Some of these weapons will only work under water.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available manufacturing projects:{NEWLINE}     Gas Cannon{NEWLINE}     Hydro-Jet Cannon{NEWLINE}     Torpedo Launcher"
      STR_SUPCAV: "Supercavitation Propulsion"
      STR_SUPCAV_DUMMY: "Supercavitation Propulsion"
      STR_SUPCAV_UFOPEDIA: "Supercavitation is the use of cavitation effects to create a bubble of vapor inside a liquid large enough to encompass an object traveling through the liquid, greatly reducing the skin friction drag on the object and enabling the achievement of very high speeds. Possible implementations include not only upgraded weapon projectiles, but possibly even the application of these principles to whole crafts."
      STR_SUPCAV_AMMO: "Supercavitating Ammo"
      STR_SUPCAV_AMMO_DUMMY: "Supercavitating Ammo"
      STR_SUPCAV_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "We have developed a supercavitation engine small enough to fit into a bullet. Integrating this technology will significantly improve the damage output of our underwater weapons.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available manufacturing projects:{NEWLINE}     Craft Gas Cannon{NEWLINE}     SC Dart Clip{NEWLINE}     SC Harpoon Clip{NEWLINE}     HJ SC Ammo"
      STR_STUN_AMMO: "Stun Ammo"
      STR_H_ACID: "Hydrophobic Acid"
      STR_H_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "We discovered a new class of organic acids, immiscible with water. A drop of this highly corrosive liquid can float freely without losing integrity until it makes contact with an obstacle. Upon contact the acid's adhesive properties cause it to spread to form a thinly covering film. This can become a dangerous weapon if used correctly."
      STR_H_ACID_WEAPONS: "Acid Weapons"
      STR_H_ACID_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Our common weapons have too small of rounds to carry sufficient quantities of corrosive liquids, so we've developed a pair of special weapon designs to use with hydrophobic corrosive compounds."
      STR_H_ACID_PROTECTION: "Protection from Acid"
      STR_PLASTIC_WEAPONS: "Aqua Plastic Armaments"
      STR_PLASTIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Using aqua plastics, we can significantly reduce weight of our equipment while preserving durability. This can be applied to explosive weapons as well as mechanical weapons."
      STR_ULTRADENSE: "Ultradense Materials"
      STR_ULTRADENSE_UFOPEDIA: "Using Alien cryogenic technology and Zrbite as a catalyst, we've successfully copied Naga trident blades by producing replicas from ultradense materials. Now we just need to find further useful applications for this wonderful new technology."
      STR_ZRBITE_AMMO: "Zrbite Ammunition"
      STR_ZRBITE_AMMO_DUMMY: "Zrbite Ammunition"
      STR_ZRBITE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "With enough experience in new aqua plastic weapons fabrication, we can develop a process which induces Zrbite to release all its energy in a blast. While detonating Zrbite is a waste of its true potential, the resulting explosions can cause massive destruction. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available manufacturing projects:{NEWLINE}     GC Zrbite Bolts{NEWLINE}     HJ Zrbite Ammo{NEWLINE}     Zrbite Torpedo"
      STR_ADVANCED_BIONIC: "Advanced Bionics"
      STR_GAUSS_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "Our knowledge of Alien magnetic field manipulation allows us to create new armament technology. Using particle accelerators from plasma weapons as power sources and stable magnetic fields instead of projectile casings, we can effectively achieve almost unlimited underwater range."
      STR_SONIC_TECH: "Sonic Technology"
      STR_SONIC_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "All Alien sonic weapons have been found to have no triggers or buttons, and dismantling them has revealed relatively large volumes of organic tissue inside. We now suspect that Alien implants are capable of operating these weapons, but we are still lost in conjecture about how this is possible."
      STR_SONIC_WM: "Sonic Weapons Manufacturing"
      STR_SONIC_WM_UFOPEDIA: "By combining our knowledge of sonic weapon operation with our findings from researching a live {NEWLINE}Bio-drone, we can develop this kind of weapons for ourselves."
      STR_ALIEN_MOLECTRONIC: "Alien Molectronics"
      STR_ALIEN_MOLECTRONIC_DUMMY: "Alien Molectronics"
      STR_ALIEN_MOLECTRONIC_UP: "After multiple examination of cybernetic devices implanted into the bodies of our enemies, we've managed to learn about the structure of some of them. These circuits are superior to anything that humans have invented, and we cannot reproduce them. Nevertheless, we were able to operate some of them. Learning about this technology will greatly advance the scientific capabilities of all of humanity, and it will be of immediate benefit to X-Com."
      STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS: "Alien Implants"
      STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS_DUMMY: "Alien Implants"
      STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS_UP: "Further analysis of Alien cybernetic devices reveals an amazing picture. It seems that Aliens use implanted electronics as naturally as their own limbs. It is not only for communication, but all Alien devices, weapons, and even some creatures are controlled through implants. If we could adopt these devices it would be of great benefit to us on the battlefield and in everyday life. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}A major consequence of the Aliens implanting these devices is their full immunity to Psionic signal interference. This means our research on Psionics from the previous war will not be of use, and we have run tests to confirm this tragedy. We must quickly learn about the Aliens' new communication channels and frequencies so we can listen to, interpret, and disrupt them."
      STR_WORMS_EVOLVE: "Evolution of Mind Worms"
      STR_WORMS_EVOLVE_UFOPEDIA: "We've discovered a connection between the so called 'Mind Worms' and the so called 'Locusts' through our research. Our main hypothesis at this time is that Mind Worms possess an enormous capability to adapt to environmental conditions, the source of which lies in the Alien genetic programming written into each of their cells. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Since we do not have adequate knowledge of Alien genetics, we cannot predict their next form. What we do know about worms at the moment is that they can float, create hard mineralized shells, and that they group in large hordes. Most importantly, though, is that they can sense neural activity at long range and interfere with it, causing panic and stun damage."
      STR_WORMS_HATCHERY: "Mind Worms Hatchery"
      STR_WORMS_HATCHERY_UFOPEDIA: "The samples found on the floating island prove the theory of the artificial evolution of Mind Worms.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Activation of some specimens during our operation can be explained by the Mind Worms' ability to sense brain waves. The thought of an island like this coming close to major city and fully activating brings chills to our bones. We must destroy those islands as quickly as we can."
      STR_MC_LAB_PRE: "Molecular Control"
      STR_MC_LAB_PRE_UFOPEDIA: "From battle reports of our aquanauts we know that some aliens are capable of causing panic in or even taking control of a human body, even though no Psionic activity was detected. Interrogation of such a special creature will give us clues about these capabilities. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We also suspect that these aliens have a special type of implant. Research indicates that some Alien species are more capable of utilizing these implants than others, and some of them have mastered it enough to directly manipulate fine electromagnetic fields around them. Some can even manipulate these fields precisely enough to cause interferences in the neural system of a subject or even gain control over its body. Additionally, the implants make aliens highly resistant to Psionic attacks. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We believe that on the highest levels of molecular control mastery it may be possible to control matter directly, as some kind of telekinesis. We are also confident that Zrbite is connected to that possibility somehow."
      STR_MC_BIO: "Biological Molecular Control"
      STR_MC_BIO_UFOPEDIA: "While researching Mind Worms our biologists discovered an organ working as natural electromagnetic field emitter. We do not know if is this an experimental specimen created by the aliens or a natural extraterrestrial evolutionary result. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Deep research of this tissue has lead us to some great discoveries, including the new use of Molectronic implants. Instead of just gaining control over Alien devices, we now possess the capability to interfere with a live organism's neural system to cause intense shock or maybe even issue commands."
      STR_MC_SOLDIERS: "Special Recruits"
      STR_MC_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "Progress in the adaptation of Alien implants has allowed us to recruit specially prepared aquanauts as well as build appropriate training facilities. Our researchers have designed one such facility called the M.C.-Lab, which we can now construct.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available recruit specialties: {NEWLINE}M.C.-Gifted Aquanauts: Special screening processes reveal those who are more capable of molecular control. They are not professional soldiers, so they are costly due to price and lack of training.{NEWLINE}M.C.-Protected Aquanauts: Using a special implant configuration, we can shield humans' minds from M.C. exposure. The drawback is the complete inability for these recruits to operate M.C. devices.{NEWLINE}Cyborg Aquanauts: These recruits' implants are focused on body improvement, raising all capabilities. These soldiers are stronger, faster, more agile, and better trained. They also can achieve physical characteristics that are not possible for ordinary people. The price they pay for this is diminished M.C. strength."
      STR_FL_SUBS: "Flying Submarines"
      STR_FL_SUBS_DUMMY: "Flying Submarines"
      STR_FL_SUBS_UFOPEDIA: "Flying submarines were the dream of designers and the nightmare of engineers for over a century. But with the development of photon accelerators, spearheaded by {NEWLINE}F. Denman Williams, we can design and manufacture crafts capable of flying like airplanes and swimming like dolphins. These vessels can also carry the most modern military weaponry.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available manufacturing projects:{NEWLINE}     CORMORANT"
      STR_ALIEN_WRECK: "Old Alien Flight Records"
      STR_ALIEN_WRECK_UFOPEDIA: "The Alien data slate found in the UFO crash site contained UFO flight records. X-Com's own historic radar records indicate that some UFOs simply flew over the seas, apparently doing nothing substantial. Some of these UFOs were shot down over water and were assumed to be destroyed. We can now match the Alien data with old radar records to determine which of these sunken UFOs sent out distress signals, meaning they weren't completely destroyed. We'll then send out patrols to search for alloy concentrations or magnetic anomalies to find these sunken UFOs.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Additionally, the Alien records give us proof that Aliens were searching for something called 'The Silent One'. It is obvious now that whatever it was, it is associated with our new enemy. Their records also indicate that the final phase of their search involved battleship deployment, and our radar records show that this particular battleship was neutralized over water. We must locate this underwater crash site and search it for clues."
      STR_DEVICE: "Mysterious Alien Device"
      STR_ALIEN_CODES: "Old Alien Beacon"
      STR_ALIEN_CODES_UFOPEDIA: "This device resembles a short-range hyperwave transmitter, calibrated for the various frequencies of common Alien hypercommunications. It appears its purpose is to connect with something on the sea bottom. Our specialists will contact global telecommunications corporations and begin hyperwave scanning on the given frequencies."

At the Heart of the city is an Alien horror so vile and so powerful that not even death can claim it. In a chamber of Alien metal lies the sleeping form of the great dreamer, the Ultimate Alien. Raising T'leth above the waves will begin its re-animation cycle, and once risen it will be unstoppable. Although not alive and somehow not dead, the Alien mind controls the Alien army. The weird technology of molecular control connects all Aliens to the One mind and the One mind to all Aliens. Genetically mutated Alien/human fetuses supply the Alien mind with energy and form the link between the ruler and his subjects. The myth of the Ultimate Alien has existed in the hearts and minds of humankind for centuries, but the sea has always hidden the ultimate truth. Not a single Alien ship can reach T'leth autonomously. All who are not under control of the Alien mind will be misguided or destroyed by the city's defense systems. If we want to stage an assault on T'leth, we need two things: a ship capable of diving to such a depth, and a key to bypass the Alien defense network."

These tentacles are tipped with sharp, venomous needles, which can pierce light armor. While their gelatinous bodies are quite fragile, we're best off dispatching them at a distance."
      STR_SLIME_AUTOPSY: "Creeper autopsy"
      STR_SLIME_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Although these creatures looks like a tangle of thin tentacles, their closest ancestor is the starfish. The bodies of creepers contain many genetically different organs, presumably implanted artificially."

Upon dying, the pressurized water in their bodies is abruptly released, which typically produces a small explosion."
      STR_SERVITOR_AUTOPSY: "Scullshrimp autopsy"
      STR_SERVITOR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Little is left of these creatures after death. Huge, built-up pressures in their skull-like bodies tear them to tiny pieces when they die.

We now have proof that these underwater snakes have established their own civilization on the sea bottom. It seems like they've agreed to form an alliance with the Aliens, and therefore represent a serious danger to us."
      STR_NAGA_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Internal structures in Naga bodies prove that they are indeed Earth creatures. DNA testing traces their origin to the Cretaceous or even the Jurassic period. Small cybernetic implants were found in their brains surrounded by relatively fresh scarring."

      STR_ABOMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "This abomination is barely sentient, despite its outstanding capabilities for Molecular Control, or perhaps even because of them. Its M.C. Skill is powerful enough to project a kind of ionized shield over its body, which can slow down bullets and weaken sonic waves. Even the movement of some of these beings depends on M.C. capability because not all of these creatures have all of their limbs."
      STR_ABOMINATION_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "These creatures look... unfinished. Some organs and even body parts can be missing, while some are replaced with cybernetics. It looks like they are the results of unfinished cloning experiments which were released from the cloning tanks before the growth process had finished.

These poor people are obsessed with their god, who they call the Sleeping One. All we were able to get from them were vague threats and promises of revenge from 'His Servants'. Apparently, some kind of mental suppression treatments were used on them, but no signs of Psionic exposure were found."

      STR_OCT_UFOPEDIA: "Despite the horrific shape, these are extremely intelligent beings. Their implants work as some kind of antennae or signal amplifiers, increasing their already huge M.C. potential and making them truly terrible foes. They will rarely attack up close, but if they do their mighty tentacles can rip an aquanaut in half."
      STR_OCT_AUTOPSY: Oct autopsy
      STR_OCT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The body of this giant octopus has been infused with hundreds of cybernetic enhancements, making it nearer to a robot than a living creature. The presence of reproductive organs is diminished in favor of a highly complex central nervous system."

      STR_GHOST_UFOPEDIA: "A covey of tiny drones forming shapeless clouds in the water. Alone they are harmless, but en masse they create powerful electromagnetic impulses, capable of boiling a human brain inside heavy armor. Our aquanauts call them 'Ghosts' because bot swarms sometimes resemble the shape of a transparent human body."
      STR_GHOST_AUTOPSY: Ghost Wreck Examination
      STR_GHOST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Single drones consist of tiny ion pulse engines and relatively simple logical circuits. They make minuscule movements in only one direction through twitching jumps, but an array of three to four bots is smart enough to attack or run away. Due to their small individual sizes they are resistant to projectiles, but they can be scattered by heat or a blast wave."

      STR_NEEDLER: "Needler"
      STR_NEEDLER_UFOPEDIA: "Our aquanauts have named this creature 'Needler', and it is clear why. What is a mystery, though, is how this giant sea urchin can swim so fast and how it can generate those deadly electric pulses. The good news is that they lack sensory organs, so these charges most often miss."
      STR_NEEDLER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature holds fascinating secrets. In short, it contains an organic ion beam accelerator. It is interesting to contemplate whether this is an attempt to transfer the displacer to a biological basis or, on the contrary, the source of inspiration for the Aliens' mainstay technology.{NEWLINE}A hard shell of this creature covers subtle viscera, which are relatively vulnerable to any damage. Electric pulses, used by the creature as a weapon, can be a side effect of the internal displacer's work."

      STR_NEEDLER_CORPSE: Needler Corpse
      STR_MINDWORMS: "Mind Worms"
      STR_MINDWORMS_UFOPEDIA: "These slimy worms float by flapping a tangle of appendages. Their very presence causes panic and hallucinations. While the effect generated by one specimen is almost imperceptible, close contact with a swarm may cause severe shock to anyone with a weak will. Maybe this was originally a natural defense mechanism, but now, empowered by Alien genetic experiments and mutations, their collective presence has become a powerful weapon."
      STR_MINDWORMS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This is definitely an Alien species. Its genetic structure is completely different from any life found on Earth. The most remarkable thing is that we have not found any cybernetic inclusions in their bodies."

Their very presence causes panic and hallucinations. While the effect generated by one specimen is almost imperceptible, close contact with a swarm may cause severe shock to anyone with a weak will. They are truly horrible terror weapon."
      STR_LOCUST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The inner structures of this species are similar to that of the Mind Worms. The only differences are in the rigid outer covers and degree of development of the fins. Just like their sea brethren, the bodies of Locusts do not contain any cybernetic inclusions. Due to their small sizes and hard shells, piercing weapons will be less effective against them."

      STR_ZOMBIE_WORMS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "These poor humans have completely lost their minds because of the Mind Worms' intrusion. They don't even feel the pain of the worms eating them alive. This madness has given them increased strength and ferocity. Sadly, we cannot save them because most of their organs are usually irreparably damaged or fully destroyed by the worms. Their lifespan is limited to only a few hours."

      STR_CHURCH_OF_SIRIUS2: "The Late Church of Sirius"
      STR_CHURCH_OF_SIRIUS_UFOPEDIA: "A radical new religion known as the 'Cult of Sirius' rose to prominence in early 2027. The cultists believe that humanity might well have destroyed any hope of salvation by repelling the Alien occupation during the previous Alien War. The cult has been launching numerous deep space probes since the early 2030s, each of which carrying a message begging their 'Alien Saviors' to return to Earth and use their advanced technology to divert humanity off its path of self-destruction. After becoming officially outlawed by most world governments, the cult became an underground organization.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It is not yet clear why the cultists have begun to terrorize civilians. There are rumors that to gain admission into the cult, fanatics must contribute large sums of money and goods, so there is speculation that some candidates have banded together in gangs to prove their worth and make their robbery and piracy operations more likely to succeed. We must prevent these activities and investigate the cultists' relationship with the Aliens, if there is one."
      STR_CHURCH_AGREEMENT: "Church of Sirius' Plans"
      STR_CHURCH_AGREEMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Interrogation of one of the so called 'Paladins' proves what we had suspected. These fanatics make contact with Aliens and will follow their orders in exchange for new technologies. We cannot determine, however, who made the initial contact. How did the Aliens find the Church of Sirius when our own governments have been unable to track them? {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The primary goal of the cultists is to bring about the return of their saviors, and the Aliens are promising to help with this effort. We can expect more trouble from the Cult unless we find their bases of operation and shut them down. According to the Paladins, these bases are called 'Temples' by the Cult.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Curiously enough, despite many extraterrestrial species looking similar between our old enemies and our new ones, the Church does not profess the newly emerging Aliens as their gods. We also did not find any Alien implants in scans of the cultists we've interrogated, which suggests these people are not under Alien control, but true believers."

      STR_HELLCRAB_AUTOPSY: "Hellcrab autopsy"
      STR_HELLCRAB_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature is truly a masterpiece of Alien biotechnology. Its aqua plastic carapase proves tougher than a USO hull. A Molectronic neuronet works as a dispersed brain. It also has five independent hearts. These traits leave this creature completely without a weak spot. Another remarkable thing is that the implanted sonic cannon uses not a Zrbite battery, but a 'natural' biological power source."
      STR_HELLCRAB_TERRORIST: Hellcrab Terrorist
      STR_HELLCRAB_UFOPEDIA: "This disgusting pink monstrosity can be encountered accompanying Freaks in the sea depths or on the surface. It is truly a living tank. Its carapace is almost impenetrable, and its razor-sharp claws can cut steel rails. As if this was not enough, it also possesses a powerful sonic blaster."

      STR_CARCHARODON_SQUAD_LEADER: Carcharodon Squad Leader
      STR_CARCHARODON_SOLDIER: Carcharodon Soldier
      STR_CARCHARODON_UFOPEDIA: Recent battles with X-Com have forced the Aliens to accelerate their experimentation. The Carcharodons are the result. The Aliens have taken one of the fiercest predators in the ocean and adapted them for amphibious warfare. Although highly organized and intelligent, they are unable to control their predatory instincts for very long. They often turn on their wounded after battle and thus have no medics.
      STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This new species of shark is composed of both human and Alien DNA in addition to extensive cybernetic implants, allowing it to operate on land for short periods of time. Stomach contents show this carnivore has a huge appetite for raw flesh. Razor-sharp teeth and heightened senses along with a well developed brain make this a deadly and fast predator. Its thick muscle slows the cutting power of melee weapons while its skin, composed of tiny teeth-like scales, has been reinforced with aqua plastics, protecting it from armor piercing rounds."

      STR_HEAVYAQUATOID_SOLDIER: "Enhanced Aquatoid Soldier"
      STR_HEAVYAQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "It is not clear if Aquatoids are copying the features of our armor from us or developing it themselves, but they definitely go their own way. In fact, this is not an armor suit, but a symbiotic organism, giving increased protection and physical parameters to the otherwise quite weak and vulnerable Aquatoids. As a side effect we can see significantly decreased M.C. capabilities in the wearers, which may be related to suit operating needs."

      STR_TASOTHGUARD_UFOPEDIA: "These beings represent the elite of the Alien army. They are faster, stronger, and more resilient than common Tasoth, who are already extremely dangerous. And, as icing on the cake, they are coated in sturdy armor. Only the most important Alien installations are guarded by these fearsome creatures."

      STR_HEAVYGILLMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Now we are sure that not only are we studying the Aliens, but that they are learning from us, too. After encountering our units, the Gillmen have invent reinforced exoskeletons, giving them additional protection and strength. Technicians skilled in this technology could be a useful interrogation target. {NEWLINE}Only god knows what new dangers we will face fighting an enemy so intelligent and cunning."

      STR_ABYSSIAN_SOLDIER: "Jellyman"
      STR_ABYSSIAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The gelatinous bodies of these creatures came to our research facility heavily damaged. The reason for this is their flimsy structure and rapid decomposition. All we can determine is that their tissues are adapted to the high pressure of the oceanic abyssal depths, and that their nervous system is unusually highly developed. No cybernetic enhancements were found in the remains."
      STR_ABYSSIAN_UFOPEDIA: "Jellymen, or as they call themselves, the Abyssians, are natural Earth creatures who dwell in the ocean's depths of over 10,000 feet. They are sentient and skilled in biology and fluid mechanics. On the battlefield they are dangerous opponents, preferring ranged combat and using bio-engineered organisms as weapons."
      STR_ABYSSIAN_ORIGINS: "Jellymen Origins"
      STR_ABYSSIAN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "Abyssians are an ancient civilization, living in deepest ocean caverns secretly and imperceptibly before their initial meeting with the Aliens. They are masters of genetic modifications and control of water streams. Now they have created an alliance with the Aliens, acquiring Zrbite power sources in exchange for bionic technology. Their goal now is to obtain sole control over the world's oceans.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We believe there is a possibility to negotiate with them, and maybe even to convince them to change sides in this war. We just need to find a way to speak with a high-ranking Jellyman official."
      STR_ABYSSIAN_TREATY: "Jellymen Treaty"
      STR_ABYSSIAN_TREATY_UFOPEDIA: "We were able to reach an agreement with Abyssians. They will stop aggressive actions against humanity in exchange for humans agreeing to meet certain conditions, mainly of ecological character. This treaty could be the beginning of a new era for humanity."
      STR_ABYSSIAN_TRADE: "Jellymen Tech Exchange"

      STR_PROTOBIONT: "Protobiont Physiology"
      STR_PROTOBIONT_UFOPEDIA: "We now possess conclusive data about the green gelatinous amoebae found inside Calcinite suits. These beings have no cellular structure, much like the first living organisms on Earth. They can be described as a complex mixture of proteins closer, to viruses than bacteria. In macroscopic quantities, they can move effectively and even pursue prey. Growth is limited only by food availability. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Fortunately, humans are immune to Protobiont infection, so these organisms won't start an epidemic, but if injected into the bloodstream in large doses, they will devour any animal or human in seconds. As side effect of fast growth, they will heat up and emit extremely toxic waste.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These organisms can be found naturally in the deepest caverns of the ocean bottom, protected from modern bacteria by extreme pressure and darkness, feeding off carrion. Aliens pack collections of Protobionts into hard shells and control them with Molectronic devices, turning them into strong and resilient puppets."

#Abyssian stuff
      STR_SPAWNER: "Breeder"
      STR_SPAWNER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. It can spawn aggressive larvae, which attack the target and chew through armor using highly corrosive venom. Damages armor and morale. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
      STR_SUPRESSOR: "Squeezer"
      STR_SUPRESSOR_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. Our researchers assert unanimously that the physical principles behind its actions are impossible. It can compress water around its targets, tearing them apart with a concentrated resultant vacuum pressure. Damages armor and TU. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
      STR_TANGLER: "Tangler"
      STR_TANGLER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. It spits fast-hardening threads over short distances, tangling targets. Jellymen probably use these weapons to capture targets alive. Damages TU and delivers small amounts of stun damage. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
      STR_INFECTOR: "Infector"
      STR_INFECTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. These creepy weapons release small larvae, acting as biosyringes to inject hyperactive organic fluids into the target. This infection can devour a human body in seconds, leaving a shapeless puddle of mucus in its place. This amoebic body is actually a protozoan form of a Calcinite. Use of these weapons seems too dangerous for our aquanauts."
      STR_VAMPIRE_WEAPON: "Vampire"
      STR_VAMPIRE_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "This unusual symbiont is used by Jellymen as a melee weapon of sorts. It can not only pierce armor with its claws, but simultaneously sucks blood from its targets. It then heals its master by injecting specific regenerative cells into the master's bloodstream."
